--- GAME DESIGN FINAL PROJECT: By Daniel Garcia ---
MAG-NANIMOUS!... MAGNETIC-MOUS? This game doesn't really have a title but it has to do with platforming and MAGNETS!

By the time you finally come to, you realize you're in the middle of this... futuristic science factory. 
There's an eerie silence to it all, and you don't even know how you got here! 
...Welp, no time to think about it now! Gotta get the hell outta here! But.. what's the deal with that BIG MAGNET in your hand?
WOAH! Was that some sorta- *gulp* robot over there?! It seem's violent... 
Hmm, METAL BOXES are scattered all over this place. Maybe... this MAGNET and these BOXES might just come in handy!

***Controls***
WASD keys to MOVE! A for LEFT, D for RIGHT. S to CROUCH, W to LOOK UP.
W key to CLIMB UP ladders, S key to CLIMB DOWN them.
J key to RUN! Increases your running speed.
K key to JUMP! Jump over pits and obstacles. Combine with running to jump farther!

***Magnet Controls***
L key to MAGNETIZE! Attract Metal Boxes to you to defend yourself against these machinnes. You can Magnetize while moving, crouching, climbing, looking up and in the air.
Space key for a MAGNET SHOT! Once you've attracted a metal box, press the space key to launch it as a projectile towards your enemies.
You can launch a Magnet Shot at any time, but be careful as you can't attract any more metal boxes until you release the one you have [the original plan was to have launched metal boxes destroyed on impact but time constraints made it so the boxes remained even after destroying an enemy; talk about busted].
Like Magnetizing, Magnet Shots can be launched while moving, crouching [not reccomended, loses momentum since its closer to the ground], climbing, upwards and in the air.

***Enemies***
ROOMBA: Noisy lil' vacuum machine that's more of a inconvenience than a threat. Doesn't hurt you but will push you around.
DRONE: Speedy machines that zip in the air. Once your caught in their sight [radius] they'll shoot a total of ONE bullet at you... every few seconds...
ROBOT: While Roombas and Drones are defeated in 1 hit, Robots can take up to TWO hits before breaking down. If you're caught in their sight [radius}
they'll a total of TWO bullets at you every few seconds.

***STATS & GOAL***
You can take a total of3 hits before its GAME OVER! Make your way through the machines in this factory and reach the EXIT to WIN!
[There are no kill planes so if you fall into the abyss just reload the Scene]
